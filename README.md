## Overview
Decision Trees are versatile algorithms that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. This repository, demonstrate:

- Decision Tree Classifier: Applied to company data for market segmentation based on shelf location in stores.
- Decision Tree Regressor: Used for predicting continuous values like sales based on multiple predictors.
- Fraud Check: Decision Trees applied to identify risky transactions.

## Repository Structure
- src/: This directory contains the source code for the decision tree models.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with detailed explorations and visualizations.
- 
## Data Description
- Company Data: Includes features like Sales, CompPrice, Income, Advertising, etc., used to classify shelf location.
- Fraud Check Data: Contains attributes related to customer demographics and risk features used to classify transactions as risky or safe.
- 
## Models
- Decision Tree Classifier: Used for predicting categorical variables.
- Decision Tree Regressor: Used for predicting continuous variables.
- Model Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
